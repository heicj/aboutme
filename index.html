        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I grew up in Astoria, Oregon.  I moved to Corvallis to go to OSU and then to Portland to finish at PSU.  I've been in Portland 
        for almost 10 years.  My wife's name is Carolyn and we have <b>two</b> kids, <em>Amelia</em> and <em>Ayden</em>.</p>
        <p>I'm excited about learning to code and a career change.  Coding most intrigues me because of the all the possiblities of what <br>
           you can create.  Creating a program or idea you have in your head and seeing it work on the computer is exciting.
